# Artemis Studios Website
This is the repository for the website hosted at https://artemisdev.tech. The production build of the website can be found there, or you can find it [here](https://14studios.github.io).

## How can I run this website myself on my own machine?
All you need to do is clone the Git repo and access the index.html file. The website is completely independent, and all required resources are included in the repository.
